          After a young pirate orphan was imprisoned by the Clockwork Armada for
          rebelling against their tyranny, they are rescued by the pirate duo
          Boochbeard and Mr. Gandry of the Polarian Army. To seek refuge from
          this powerful threat, the young pirate allies themselves with Captain
          Avery of Skull Island. Doing tasks to earn their keep, the player
          quickly finds themselves entangled in a plot to find the mythical land
          of El Dorado, the City of Gold, before the Armada, or any other
          pirate, can.
          <br /><br />
          The fictional universe of the Spiral is divided into several worlds,
          each consisting of multiple areas. The game's content is divided into
          numerous "Books", which are further subdivided into individual
          "Chapters". Players may purchase access to all areas related to a
          given Chapter using "Crowns", the game's premium currency. Purchasing
          a membership grants unlimited access to all Chapters for a limited
          time. Upon character creation, players are given free access to
          "Introduction" and to "Prologue Part 1", the first Book. <br /><br />
          As the player progresses, more areas become available. Currently, the
          maximum level a character can obtain is Level 70. The main storyline
          takes the player through Skull Island, Monquista, Valencia, Cool
          Ranch, MooShu, Marleybone, and Aquila.
          <br /><br />
          Side activities in the Spiral include Practice
          <abbr title="Player versus Player">PvP</abbr>, Ranked PvP, a nautical
          gauntlet, training pets, pet sparring, and housing. <br /><br />
          The game was officially released on October 15, 2012.
