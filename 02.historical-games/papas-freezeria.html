          Papas Freezeria is a classical 2010's game.<br /><br />You've just
          started an easy job at an ice cream shop on a laidback tropical
          island, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's loyal customers
          arrive on the island for vacation! You'll need to add ingredients,
          blend syrups and ice cream, add toppings, and serve delicious
          Freezeria Sundaes to your waiting customers!
        </p>
        <img

        <p>
          This latest game features dozens of syrups, candies, and toppings that
          unlock as you play, and a variety of new and returning customers
          looking to beat the heat with your ice cream sundaes. The
          time-management and hands-on gameplay of the series is back, with new
          challenges related to blending ingredients and serving the right
          amount of ice cream in sundae cups. Challenging "Closer" customers and
          the Food Critic return from "Papa's Taco Mia!", as well as weekly
          paychecks, upgrades, and 80 in-game Badges to earn while serving ice
          cream.
          <br /><br />
          New to the series, the sundae shop features over 100 lobby decorations
          that you can purchase in the Furniture Shop, with each item affecting
          your scores while playing. You can place decorations any way you like
          in your lobby, letting you fully customize your shop with wallpaper,
          posters, furniture and more. Go for a Tiki Island theme, add
          bookshelves and coffee stands, fill the room with jukeboxes - the
          choice is yours!
          <br /><br />
          The game was officially released on August 5, 2011.
