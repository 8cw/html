			- _self — Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked

			- _parent — Opens the document in the parent frame (only useful with iframe)
			- _top — Opens the document in the full body of the window (only useful with iframe)

    <!-- images, with src, alt, and width/height attributes
		- two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:
			a) Absolute URL — Links to an external image that is hosted on another website — src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg"
			b) Relative URL — Links to an image that is hosted within the website. URL does not include the domain name.
			   If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page
			   e.g., src="img_girl.jpg"
			         src="/images/img_girl.jpg" 
		- should always contain the width/height attributes, and the alt (alternate text).
		- it is better to reference the width/height by using the "style" — this prevents CSS from changing the image.

			- Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
			- Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
			- External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file
		 - usually we keep the styles in external CSS files
