          Wizard 101 is a classical 2000's game.<br /><br />Wizard101 is an
          online Wizard school adventure with collectible card magic, wizard
          duels, and far off worlds!
          <br />
          The game allows players to create a student Wizard in an attempt to
          save Wizard City and explore many different worlds.

          The fictional universe of the Spiral is divided into many worlds, each
          of which has multiple areas. Players can unlock these temporarily with
          "memberships" or unlock each area permanently with the game's premium
          currency "Crowns." A wizard first starting the game must choose a
          school: Fire, Ice, Storm, Myth, Life, Death, or Balance, each complete
          with their own set of unique spells and playstyles.
          <br /><br />
          The game is based around "duels": two teams made up of one to four
          players or computer enemies on each team who take turns casting
          spells. Spells can be cast using "pips." A player gains one pip every
          round, and there is a chance that that pip will be a "power pip,"
          worth two regular pips for spells that are of the player's class.
          Spells can reduce the health of enemy creatures, increase the health
          of yourself or allies, add shields that reduce damage, add blades that
          modify the amount of damage done, traps, buffs which increase damage,
          and more. When a player reduces a computer enemy's health to zero,
          they are defeated; players with a health of zero can be healed by
          others on their team unless they "flee" the duel. When every player or
          computer on a team has zero health, the other team wins.
          <br /><br />
          As the player progresses, more worlds become available. There are many
          main worlds, with a few smaller side ones that are optional. When
          wizards level up, they gain new badge titles and automatic increases
          in their base statistics: health, mana, and energy. Most equipment
          also has level restrictions. Hobbies such as training pets, fishing,
          and gardening require energy; crafting instead requires various
          resources called "reagents". Players can duel each other in the PvP
          arena and some houses. As of November 2020, players can achieve a
          maximum level of 140.
          <br /><br />
          The game was officially released in 2008.
